I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI'm currently in a read-only planning mode, which means I can:\n- **Explore** your codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read\n- **Analyze** existing code patterns and architecture\n- **Design** detailed implementation plans\n- **Identify** critical files and dependencies\n\nHowever, I cannot modify, create, or delete any files - my role is strictly for exploration and planning.\n\nI can see I'm in the `/app` directory of a git repository. The git status shows some untracked files including:\n- `.claude.json` files\n- `projects/` directory\n- `shell-snapshots/` directory\n- `statsig/` directory\n- `todos/` directory\n\n**How can I help you today?** \n\nYou can:\n1. Ask me to explore specific parts of the codebase\n2. Provide requirements for a feature you'd like to implement\n3. Request analysis of existing code patterns\n4. Have me design an implementation plan for a new feature\n\nWhat would you like to focus on?","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":982,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":255}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"0453745e-0843-4455-bfa4-eee021a031a0","timestamp":"2025-12-03T15:06:02.816Z"}
